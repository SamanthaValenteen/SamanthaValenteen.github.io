							<h2>Heart to Part</h2>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/VARA.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>It's impossible to go through life without experiencing negative emotions, and I think it's
                            a good exercise for everyone to find healthy ways to address these feelings that work for them.
                            From personal experience, I've always found that simply verbalizing my thoughts helps me to address
                            and organize them. Then I can more easily find and tackle the source of them, or sometime just
                            getting the thoughts out is all I need.</p>

							<p>It's not always possible (or wise) to do this venting to someone around you, or you may not feel
                                comfortable doing to. I was interested in learning more about how chatbots work, so I thought
                                it was a good learning opportunity to create a tool for this situation. Instead of
                            a heart to heart, I made Heart to Part. It's a space to open up to a chatbot without judgment in
                            <a href="m.me/102437291478684" target="_blank">VARA,</a>
                                 your venting and raging assistant.</p>

                            <p>VARA is pretty simple at the moment, but the intention is that she doesn't offer much advice,
                            she just gives you a space to vent. This project is mostly an outlet for my learning about chatbots,
                            but I also made it public just in case it could help anyone else. Anyone interested should be aware
                            that I'll be able to view all messages sent, though I intend to only check the inbox for my own
                            debugging purposes.</p>
