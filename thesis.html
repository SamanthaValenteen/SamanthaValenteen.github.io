							<p> During my undergraduate career, I worked with Dr. Jeremy Darling on a project that attempted to measure the first Raman spectrum of the interstellar medium. This project was my first introduction to programming and real world applications of my classes, and took quite a bit longer to complete than expected. Our work did not definitively measure a Raman spectrum, but provided useful conclusions and acted as the subject of my undergraduate honors thesis. My work on this thesis, found below for any interested further, allowed me to graduate summa cum laude.</p>
